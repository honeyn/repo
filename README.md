1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

To evaluate the feasibility of adopting Playwright as a primary tool for web application testing within the organization. This document will assess Playwright's features, technical requirements, operational impact, costs, and potential benefits.

1.2 Scope

This feasibility study covers the technical, operational, and financial aspects of adopting Playwright for automated testing. It also compares Playwright with other popular testing tools like Selenium and Cypress.

1.3 Audience

The primary audience includes software development teams, QA managers, DevOps engineers, and decision-makers within the organization responsible for technology adoption.

2. Overview of Playwright
2.1 What is Playwright?

Playwright is an open-source testing automation tool developed by Microsoft that allows for testing web applications across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and platforms. It offers support for multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java.

2.2 Key Features of Playwright

Cross-browser Testing: Supports testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
Auto-waiting Mechanism: Automatically waits for elements to be actionable before performing actions.
Multiple Language Support: Compatible with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.
Parallel Testing: Offers fast parallel execution capabilities for tests.
Network Interception: Allows interception and modification of network requests and responses.
Rich API for Automation: Provides APIs for page navigation, actions, and state management.
2.3 Comparison with Other Testing Tools

Playwright vs. Selenium: Discuss differences in speed, architecture, browser support, and ease of use.
Playwright vs. Cypress: Discuss differences in cross-browser support, network stubbing, and support for multiple languages.
Playwright vs. Puppeteer: Analyze the similarities and differences in their API design, cross-browser support, and advanced features.
3. Business Requirements

Difficulty in parallel execution, leading to longer testing cycles.
Integration challenges with CI/CD pipelines.
3.2 Desired Outcomes

Increased test reliability and reduced flakiness.
Broader cross-browser and cross-platform coverage.
Shorter testing cycles with parallel execution.
Seamless integration with existing CI/CD pipelines.
3.3 Requirements for Tool Adoption

Compatibility with current test environments and frameworks.
Ease of adoption and low learning curve.
Comprehensive documentation and community support.
Scalability to support growing testing needs.
4. Technical Feasibility
4.1 Supported Platforms and Languages

Playwright supports Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It also works with major programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET, making it a versatile choice for various teams.

4.2 Integration with Existing CI/CD Pipelines

Playwright can integrate with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps, allowing for automated testing in development pipelines.

4.3 Compatibility with Current Applications

Playwrightâ€™s ability to support multiple browsers ensures compatibility with applications requiring comprehensive cross-browser testing.

4.4 Browser Support and Capabilities

Supports Chromium (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and WebKit (Safari), covering all major browsers.

5. Operational Feasibility
5.1 Learning Curve and Training Needs
